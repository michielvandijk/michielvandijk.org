Michiel van Dijk is a senior researcher at Wageningen Economic Research, part of [Wageningen University and Research](www.wur.nl) and a guest research scholar at the [International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA)](https://iiasa.ac.at/). He previously held positions as associate professor at Eindhoven University of Technology, researcher at the [Centre for Research on Multinational Corporations (SOMO)](www.somo.nl) and West Africa campaigns officer at [Oxfam Netherlands](https://www.oxfamnovib.nl/). From 2016 to 2020 he was a Research Scholar at IIASA. His research interests include the analysis of agricultural production, food security and climate change using a combination of global simulation models, micro-econometrics and spatial analysis. He has been a (lead) researcher in projects funded by CIMMYT, DFID, USAID, GEF, UNIDO, World Bank and the EU and has extensive working experience in Africa, Asia and Latin America. He holds a PhD in Technology and Development Studies from Eindhoven University of Technology and a MSc. in Quantitative Economics from Maastricht University.

modeling of the [water-energy-land nexus](https://iiasa.ac.at/web/home/research/iswel/ISWEL.html)

I obtained my M.Sc. degree in quantitative economics from Maastricht University in 1999. In the same year I started with my PhD in technology and development studies at Eindhoven University of Technology. In my pHd thesis I studied the the development and 'catching up' of the Indonesian pulp and paper industry, which was one of the fastest (but not necessarily positive) developing industrial sectors in Indonesia in the 1990s. In my thesis I tried to insights from economics and innovation studies with industry characteristics related to technical and engineering features of this particular sector. The project was linked to the [Groningen Growth and Development Centre (GGDC)](https://www.rug.nl/ggdc/?lang=en) research of analysing long-run growth to better understand economic development. To collect data and enhance my understanding of the industry, I spend eight months at the Centre for Strategic and 
I received my PhD in 2004 and related papers can be found here, here and here.  

After my PhD I stayed a year at the Eindhoven University of Technology as assistent professor responsible for a courses on Development Planning, Economics of Technical Change and Globalization. After this I felt it was time to get more practical experience in development and (voluntarily) worked for as lending officer for a small micro-finance institution in Maracay Venezuela. 

In 2005 I joined the [Centre for Research on Multinational Corporations (SOMO)](www.somo.nl) as researcher on tax and finance issues. I was one of the lead authors on a report titled [The Netherlands: A tax haven?](https://www.somo.nl/the-netherlands-a-tax-haven/?noredirect=en_GB) that analyzed whether the Netherlands could be regard as a tax haven, which was featured on the front page of one of the [major Dutch newspapers](https://www.volkskrant.nl/nieuws-achtergrond/fiscus-lokt-dagelijks-5-papieren-bv-s-naar-nederland~b91321c5/), the Dutch news, [the New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/04/business/yourmoney/04amster.html) and Le Monde. It was probably the first major report that tried to analyze this topic in detail and brought it to the attention of the general public. Interestingly, the question whether the Netherlands can be considered as a tax haven is still relevant today.

From 2008 till 2011 I worked for [Oxfam Novib](https://www.oxfamnovib.nl/), the Dutch branch of the international NGO Oxfam, as West African Campaigns officer. My main task was to support and facilitate the regional 'Economic Justice' campaign in collaboration with representatives from other Oxfams, local NGOs and small farmers associations. I mainly focussed on agricultural topics and spend most time in Nigeria and Ghana with regular visits to Burkina Faso, Senegal and Mali. During my time at Oxfam, I became interested in the role of small-scale farming in economic development countries and broader related topics such as food security and agricultural innovation.

As I was missing research, I decided to move back to (applied) research and started as researcher at [Wageningen Economic Research](https://www.wur.nl/en/Research-Results/Research-Institutes/Economic-Research.htm) (at that time still named LEI Wageningen), which is part of [Wageningen University](https://www.wur.nl/en.htm) in 2011. I was lucky to get immediately involved in the EU funded [FOODSECURE](https://www.foodsecure.eu/) project, which aim was to assess future global food security under different scenarios using an ensemble of models, including our in-house global computable general equilibrium (CGE) model [MAGNET](https://www.magnet-model.org/). In 2012, I participated in the [GTAP](https://www.gtap.agecon.purdue.edu/) course to improve my understanding of CGE modelling. I was responsible for leading a work package that developed the scenarios for further modelling, which results are publised [here] and [here].

I also started to collaborate with colleagues from the Plant Production Systems (PPS) of Wageningen university on yield gap analysis, which looks at the gap between potential and actual agricultural production. As part of the [Global Yield Gap Atlas (GYGA)](http://www.yieldgap.org/), we developed a framework to disentangle the agronomic and economic determinants of the yield gap and identified the policies that would address each of these factors. The framework with and application to Tanzania and follow up research on Ethiopia can be found here and here, respectively.  

To expand my horizon, I joined IIASAâ€™s Ecosystems Services and Management Program (ESM) as a Research Scholar in November 2016. 

At IIASA I mainly worked on the Integrated Solutions for Water, Energy, and Land (IS-WEL) project funded by IIASA, UNIDO and GEF to assess the food-energy-water nexus at global and sub-regional level using a combination of models. My main contribution was the development of the GLOBIOM model by integrating and linking micro-level survey data. 

Mid 2020, I moved back to Wageninge Economic Research to resume my position as senior research. I am currently working on projects to 

In addition, Dr. van Dijk is involved in projects funded by DFID and CIMMYT to analyze maize yield gaps in several African countries using integrating agronomic and economic approaches and he participates in the scenario development and modeling of global food and nutrition security futures as part of the FP7 FOODSECURE project. Previous projects included the assessment of climate change, food security and poverty in Ghana, the analysis of future land use in Vietnam and an assessment of the bio-based economy in Malaysia.
