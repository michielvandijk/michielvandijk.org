Michiel van Dijk joined IIASAâ€™s Ecosystems Services and Management Program (ESM) as a Research Scholar in November 2016. He is a development economist with interest in the analysis and assessment of technology, food security and agricultural policies in developing countries and emerging economies using integrated assessment models, econometrics and scenario analysis.

Currently Dr. Van Dijk works on the Integrated Solutions for Water, Energy, and Land (IS-WEL) project funded by IIASA, UNIDO and GEF to assess the food-energy-water nexus at global and sub-regional level using a combination of models. He will also contribute to the development of the GLOBIOM model by integrating and linking micro-level survey data. In addition, Dr. van Dijk is involved in projects funded by DFID and CIMMYT to analyze maize yield gaps in several African countries using integrating agronomic and economic approaches and he participates in the scenario development and modeling of global food and nutrition security futures as part of the FP7 FOODSECURE project. Previous projects included the assessment of climate change, food security and poverty in Ghana, the analysis of future land use in Vietnam and an assessment of the bio-based economy in Malaysia.

Dr. van Dijk received his PhD from Eindhoven University of Technology, in the field of technology and development studies. Prior to joining IIASA, he held various positions as assistant professor, researcher and campaigns officer at Eindhoven University of Technology, Centre for Research on Multinational Corporations (SOMO), Oxfam Netherlands and Wageningen Economic Research (formerly known as LEI), where he is continuing his assignment as senior researcher for one day per week.
