# Welcome!
I am senior research in the international policy department at [Wageningen Economic Research](https://www.wur.nl/en/Research-Results/Research-Institutes/Economic-Research.htm), part of [Wageningen University and Research](www.wur.nl). In my research I try to combine insights from micro-level analysis and in particular the behaviour of small-scale farmers in developing countries, with global assessments of agricultural development, food security and climate change.
