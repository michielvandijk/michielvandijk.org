abstract: "This report looks at the African regional trade, regional integration agreements (RIAs) and the implications for food security. It starts by giving a literature review on the conceptual links between regional integration and food security, listing both theoretical and empirical findings Ã¢ the latter with the accent on agricultural trade in Arica. In the subsequent section a brief overview is presented on RIAs in Africa and the extent of intra-regional trade in agriculture and food. The analysis focuses on eight target countries: Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Mozambique, Rwanda, Tanzania, Uganda and Sudan, and the RIAs these countries have endorsed. The report continues with a summary of agricultural provisions in the RIAs followed by an analysis of the factors hampering agricultural and food trade between African countries. A distinction is made between trade barriers (mainly tariffs) and problems with infrastructure. The next section describes two Pan-African programs to promote agricultural development and food security. Finally, the report ends with a brief discussion about the implications of the findings for food security, conclusions and recommendations for follow-up research."
