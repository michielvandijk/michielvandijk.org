abstract: "Ending hunger and achieving food security - one of the UN sustainable development goals - is a major global challenge. To inform the policy debate, quantified global scenarios and projections are used to assess long-term future global food security under a range of socio-economic and climate change scenarios. However, due to differences in model design and scenario assumptions, there is uncertainty about the range of food security projections and outcomes. We reviewed 58 global food security modelling and projection studies that have been published over the last two decades and discussed the methodology and underlying drivers, and compared future trends in two key food security indicators. We found that across five representative scenarios that span divergent but plausible socio-economic futures global food demand is expected to increase by +34 to +53 between 2010 and 2050, which is a substantialy lower range than the often cited +60 to +110. The latter range is based on earlier reference years and methodologies that are difficult to compare. We also found that population at risk of hunger is projected to decrease by -89 to -12. For a subset of scenarios, food security outcomes worsen under climate change but comparison is difficult because of the small number of comparable projections. Finally, our review suggests that current modelling approaches can be improved by better incorporating several options that have been proposed to tackle global food security, in particular aquaculture and future foods, and expand the number of indicators to better cover the multiple dimensions of food security. The results of our systematic review can be used to benchmark new global food security projections and quantitative scenario studies and inform policy analysis and the public debate on the future of food."
