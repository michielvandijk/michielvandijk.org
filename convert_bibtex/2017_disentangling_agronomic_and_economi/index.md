In total WASS comprises about 250 researchers. WASS promotes top-quality research that increases our understanding of social processes and design practices around challenges and opportunities in the sphere of agriculture, food, health, environment and development. WASS provides a home for internationally oriented scholars with diverse disciplinary expertise and research traditions, and wishes to create an enabling environment for disciplinary, interdisciplinary and trans-disciplinary work.
